            The NeuroBot is a neural network algorithm created for forecasting exchange rates of cryptocurrencies. The neural network
            collects and analyses Data 24/7 and provides forecasts for various cryptocurrencies' exchange rates. There are
            three types of forecasts: 24 hours, 48 hours and one week. Neural network algorithm implemented with algorithms
            of the essential aspects of technical analysis, such as patterns and signal indicators calculate forecast Data
            with one second time. The program will be further upgraded by introducing the remaining elements of technical
            analysis (Fibonacci retracement, the Elliot wave theory , etc ) and fundamental analysis - market news algorithms
            will be implemented - one more neural network with functions to determine positive and negative tendencies of
            the market.
